Kotlin vs Go:

Both languages are performant, have a strong static compiler, are mature, have a massive community.

What we forgo when choosing one or the other:

Cons of Kotlin:
- less simple
- smaller pool of programmers with experience on it (although very close to Java)
- more integration work for auth tools like Ory Kratos or SuperTokens

Cons of Go:
- less expressive
- less constructs available to avoid technical bugs (immutability, nullability, etc...)
- no mature build tool as turn key, simple, and powerful as JVM build tools (Gradle, ...)
